# DiscHeaven Webshop Project

## Project description
This is a ASP.NET Core MVC Project. I built a webshop selling discgolf discs, similar to many of the websites that can be found online. 
You can browse many different discs, arranged into cards (styled with bootstrap). If you find one that is to your liking, you can add it to cart, and even buy it.

This was a really **fun** project. It was the final project of a fullstack web-development course I read at Lexicon Malm√∂.
I have built many webshops before during my studies but this is the first one I finished that was truly full-stack while simultaneously looking quite nice :)
It was my first BIG project using ASP.NET Core MVC and I learned a lot during the process. I also developed my bootstrap styling skills.
I learned a lot about how to pass data back and forth between view, controller and database (a skill I suspect will come in handy in the future).

The process was not without hurdles, a few reboots were needed, but I learned so much along the way.
I hope you enjoy!
